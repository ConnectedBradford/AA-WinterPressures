Old method re queueing
``````````````````````

try to seize a bed
If unavailable, increase queue size by 1
set renege_in
try again, using renege_in for delays
Once successful, decrease queue size by 1

renege_in
 - use attribute to mark pressure
 - rollback to retry seize (optionally with greater priority)


New method
``````````

Change priority to allow queueing for that ward
Set renege_in
try seize
once successful, return priority to zero

renege_in
 - use attribute to mark pressure
 - set higher priority (but nb can't go above max for that ward)
 - rollback to retry seize
 
 


Ward priorities
 - All wards have a number (idx)
 - idx*10 = minimum priority, idx*10+9 = maximum priority
 
 Default priority for elective idx*10, idx*10+1 when reneged
 
 Default priority for emergency idx*10+5, idx*10+6 when reneged
 
  set priority to - match(get_selected(env,id=1),wards$Ward)*10
