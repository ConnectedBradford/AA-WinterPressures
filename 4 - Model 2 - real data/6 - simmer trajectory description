Description of trajectories - planned

 emergency_patient
  - set all the attributes
  - set prio to 1
  - select best ward based on current priority (4=all wards in hospital)
  - try to seize best ward
   - if failed, increase prio by 1 and try again
   - if prio is 4 then there are no beds - PANIC (currently, reset prio to 1 and try again in an hour)
  - seize "bed"
  - join common_patient
  
 elective_patient
  - set all the attributes
  - set prio to 1
  - select prio 1 ward
  - try to seize best ward
   - if failed then follow elective backoff policy (likely try again in 2 weeks, minus a few minutes to represent priority), and roll back
  - seize "bed"
  - join common_patient
  
  
common_patient (nb only come here if you have a bed! don't use for handle_unfinished when wards close)
 - start at prio 1
 - is current ward on the list for current priority?
  - if so, skip to timeout
 - select best ward based on current priority (no need to look at 4, as we are already in a bed at this point)
 - try to seize best ward
  - if failed, increase prio by 1 and try again
  - if prio is 3 then just stay in present bed (skip to timeout)
 - once seized, drop old bed
 - set current ward
 - timeout to either the end of the trajectory or episode
 - adjust trajectory, episode depending on what caused us to finish
 - roll back to start if we've not hit the end of the spell
